  <h1>Vaccine Distribution Inequitable Across Maryland, Benefits Particular Counties</h1>

  <h2>Vaccine Distribution</h2>

  <p> In the state of Maryland, white individuals are being vaccinated at much higher rates than people of color, showing significantt inequities across counties. Vaccine disribution is benefitting more counties towards the eastern shore, of whom have particularly high percentages of white residents. In general, distribution is negatively affecting more urban counties and people of color.</p>

  <p>As of April 28, approximately 4.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the state of Maryland and approximately 1.9 million Marylanders are fully vaccinated. Since the state transitioned to Phase 3 of vaccinations less than three weeks prior, the rate of vaccinations has significantly increased.</p>

  <p>Across the United States, approximately 234 million doses of the vaccine have been administered. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 43% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine and 29.5% of Americans are fully vaccinated. In terms of vaccine type, 123 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been administered, alongside 102 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen vaccine.</p>

  <h2>Eligibility</h2>

  <p>All Marylanders 16 and older could be vaccinated at any of the state’s mass vaccination sites as of April 6. Following shortly after on April 12, Marylanders would be eligible to receive doses of the vaccine at any provider in the state. These dates are slightly sooner than originally anticipated, as Gov. Larry Hogan had originally announced that all Marylanders over the age of 16 would be eligible to get the vaccine on April 27.</p>

  <h2>Demographics and Inequalities</h2>

  <p>Based on the state’s current vaccination data, residents between the ages of 60 to 69 have the highest rate of vaccination. This statistic makes sense given the current circumstances, as younger populations became eligible less than a month ago.<p>

  <p>But, other vaccination data shows interesting and unequal demographics involving ethnicity, gender and race. White residents are being vaccinated at much higher rates than individuals of color, with white residents being vaccinated at nearly triple the rate of African Americans and nearly seven times the rate of Asians. Residents that are not Hispanic or Latino are also being vaccinated at significantly higher rates than Hispanic or Latino residents — nearly 2.2 million residents vaccinated versus 169,000.</p>

  <p>This vaccination gap can be further demonstrated by the rates at which counties across the state are vaccinating their residents. According to the state’s most recent data, Talbot County has administered the highest percentage of second doses of the vaccine and Howard County has the highest percentage of administered first doses of the vaccine. Additionally, Caroline County has administered the highest percentage of single doses.</p>

  <iframe title="Population with First Dose" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-F7VQC" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/F7VQC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="307"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

  <iframe title="Population with Second Dose" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-asUxx" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/asUxx/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="302"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

  <p>Each of the mentioned counties have primarily white populations — Howard County is 52% white, Talbot County is 77.8% white and Caroline County is 75.5% white, according to Maryland Demographics.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, counties like Prince George’s County, one of the wealthiest, majority Black counties across the nation, were hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic yet have a population being vaccinated at much lower rates. By the end of April, approximately 21.8% of residents had received the second dose of the vaccine and 1.9% had received a single dose vaccine — whereas the state average was ranging around 29%. On March 23, Prince George’s County residents recorded the lowest vaccination rates in the state, with only 16% of residents receiving the first dose of the vaccine, according to WUSA9. At the time, Maryland’s first dose vaccination rate was averaging 24% — demonstrating a lag in vaccination rates in areas where the pandemic hit the hardest.</p>

</script>



  <h2>Action</h2>

  <p>Gov. Larry Hogan attributed this gap across demographics to vaccine hesitancy, stating that minority groups are “refusing to take the vaccine.” African American and Latino residents make up 84% of Prince George’s County residents, yet account for significantly smaller percentages of the vaccinated population.</p>

  <p>On March 4, Hogan announced a new task force in an attempt to assist disadvantaged communities — by using data to determine which communities are lagging behind state vaccination rates, providing them with pop-up clinics and closer vaccination facilities.</p>

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" class="tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maryland providers have now administered more than 4.43 million COVID-19 vaccines as the state nears 60% of adults vaccinated.<br><br>Our case rate fell again, and our positivity rate is down to 4.04%.<br><br>Locate a provider or pre-register: <a href="https://t.co/MjHeoZ5E5J">https://t.co/MjHeoZ5E5J</a> <a href="https://t.co/ErMmlzhaNP">pic.twitter.com/ErMmlzhaNP</a></p>&mdash; Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1387045509555134468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


  <p>Nearly two months after the announcement of the task force in an effort to resolve the disparities between communities, vaccination gaps between populations based on race are still just as prominent.</p>
